# Abstract

This study investigates the factors associated with sufficient sleep duration among adults using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Through rigorous data retrieval, preprocessing, and modeling techniques, significant predictors of adequate sleep are identified, including demographic characteristics, mental health indicators, and sleep-related behaviors. Findings reveal that gender, education level, age, depression score, and frequency of feeling sleepy during the day are significant determinants of sufficient sleep duration. Males, individuals with lower education levels, and those with higher depression scores are less likely to obtain sufficient sleep, while older individuals and those who frequently feel sleepy during the day face challenges in achieving adequate rest. Despite comprehensive analysis, limitations associated with self-report data, such as recall bias and social desirability bias, are acknowledged, highlighting the need for future research incorporating objective measures of sleep to enhance validity and reliability. Overall, this study underscores the importance of understanding the multifaceted nature of factors influencing sleep duration among adults and informs targeted interventions to improve sleep hygiene and overall well-being.

# Data

For data retrieval, [`nhanesA` package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/nhanesA/versions/1.1) is used, which downloads a table from the NHANES website as is per call. Therefore, the code suffices to be fully reproducible without a data folder.
